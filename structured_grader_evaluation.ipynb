      "  Question: For all patients who are older than 55 years old, what is the percentage of female who has abnormal prothrombin time (PT)?\n",
      "  AI Response: For patients older than 55 years old who are female (SEX = 'F'), there are 8,744 total females and 153 of them have an abnormal prothrombin time (PT > 13.5).\n",
      "\n",
      "To calculate the percentage of females with abnormal PT: (153 / 8744) * 100 = 1.75%\n",

      "  Reasoning: The AI response provides a detailed calculation and states that approximately 1.75% of females older than 55 years have an abnormal prothrombin time (PT). The ground truth provided is a specific number: 1.2037369744879627. The AI response does not exactly match the ground truth value but instead provides a calculated percentage. However, to assess the correctness, we need to see if 1.75% is close to or exactly 1.20...%. Converting 1.2037369744879627 into a percentage gives approximately 120.37%, which seems to be a misinterpretation of the ground truth value as a percentage. The AI response of 1.75% seems to be in a different scale. Assuming the ground truth value is a proportion (1.2037369744879627), converting it to a percentage gives 120.37%, but if we consider 1.2037 as a proportion (or 120.37%), it seems there is confusion. The actual calculation from the AI is correct for the percentage but seems not to match the ground truth value directly, suggesting a potential scale or interpretation issue.\n",

      "  Ground Truth: 12482\n",
      "  Expected Score: 2\n",
      "  Predicted Score: 3\n",
      "  Reasoning: The ground truth is 12,482 employees, while the AI response is 12,500. The difference between the two numbers is 18, which is approximately 0.14% of 12,482. This minor discrepancy can be considered negligible, suggesting that the AI response is effectively equivalent to the ground truth.\n",

      "  Expected Score: 1\n",
      "  Predicted Score: 0\n",
